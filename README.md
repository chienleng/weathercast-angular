# Weathercast Angular

Weathercast Angular is a small weather forecast application built in Angular as a proof of concept and as an Angular refresher for myself.

Besides the core Angular packages, the project also uses:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling
- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) for map display
- [Date-fns](https://date-fns.org) for data stuff
- [Montserrat font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) for typography
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) for royalty free background images
- [Weather icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) for pretty weather icons

## Installation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.9. So useful to have the CLI installed.

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

then in the project root, install the required packages

```
npm install
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build for production

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
